# Introduction

These are some simple Selenium scripts using the [Ruby Selenium Webdriver](http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver) gem. 

# The Scripts

Just one for now:

* `google_as.rb`: Enters a query into Google and scrapes the autosuggest list. Not very smart. Takes one cmd line arg - a filename with each query on a line.

Enjoy!
